After cloning or downloading a Swift project that uses Swift Package Manager (SPM), you may need to resolve package dependencies to ensure the project builds correctly.

Steps to Resolve Package Versions

1. Open the Project in Xcode
   After cloning the repository, open the .xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file in Xcode.

2. Resolve Packages in Xcode
   - Click on File in the top menu.
   - Select Packages.
   - Click Resolve Package Versions.
   (Xcode will fetch and resolve all necessary dependencies.)

3. Build the Project
   After resolving the dependencies, build the project by pressing Cmd (âŒ˜) + B in Xcode.
